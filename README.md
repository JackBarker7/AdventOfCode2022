Solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I have done them in C++ where possible, but for some days I did it in Python instead, where language features made the sulution much quicker

Days in Python:
* Day 13 - Rather than building a custom parser for lists such as 

    ```[[],[[8],[4,[4,7],1,[7,0,4,9]],3],[[[9],[0,3,2,8]],7,[5],8],[[[5,0,9,4],9,[1,6,5]],7,[8,1,[4],[]],[]],[2,3,[[5,0,4],5,4],[4]]]``` 

    in C++, I decided to switch to Python and use `eval()`
